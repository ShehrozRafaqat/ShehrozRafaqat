# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Shehroz Ali
**MS Data Science student | BSc CS (UET Lahore) | Problem-solver who believes obsession beats talent**

> _‚ÄúObsession beats talent any day.‚Äù_

I bridge core computer-science foundations with applied data science. I like clean systems, readable code, and shipping small demos that solve real problems ‚Äî whether it's a production-ready web endpoint, a compact compiler, or an explainable ML model.
